You always have it, as in civil rights. So, when describing the issue of off-roaders on public lands, a word that more accurately defines the issue is \"permission,\" something that can be dissolved if facts change. A driverâ€™s license is a \"permission\" issued by the state. It can be denied for many reasons, such as reckless speeding. We must not use the words \"right\" and \"permission\" interchangeably.

In his column he suggests the reader put aside their dusty old playlist and “try flexing some real freedom, loosen up and go deep with these tracks to commemorate the original 13 American colonies,” which was followed by his suggested Fourth of July playlist. I had just put together a playlist the night before for a barbecue we were holding at our home with friends on the fourth, so I thought I would check out his playlist to see what I should add. What a load of garbage. Any of you who did not check out his playlist, you may want to do so, especially if you will have children listening to the music suggested. I guess Mr. Munoz has a different understanding than I do of flexing some real freedom and loosening up. It’s one thing that most of the songs suggested are obscure and hard to listen to, but in one the “F bomb” is actually thrown out and is clearly audible. Not a great choice for family barbecues, Mr. Munoz. I truly hope this is not the direction we are going to see the new owners of the Californian take.'\n",

I kept mine, my husband kept his. Additionally, when my husband became too disabled to work due to long term radiation damage he incurred when he had radiation treatment for the cancer he was diagnosed with in the 1980s, he went on Covered California which is our state\\'s administration of Obama\\'s ACA. He will be eligible for Medicare next year, but until then, the ACA is a life saver, as was his employer-based plan he had until he became disabled in 2018. Again, I think it is interesting the writer tried to back up his argument with a talking point that so many of us citizens have direct contradictory experiences. Why do our experiences contradict your understanding of the ACA? As for Ms. Harrop\\'s column (“Dems, send the wonks home,” July 23), I see the letter writer\\'s point. But Ms. Harrop makes a very good observation about wonks and non-wonks.

I’ll never forget their faces as they laughed and clapped. You cannot shift the blame to anyone else. It’s you, Mr. President, and your incendiary, racist rhetoric that fuels such hatred and motivates cold-blooded murder. If the president won’t dial back the hate speech, how about the rest of the GOP?

For people of color, LGBTQ people, women seeking advancements equal to men, people with disabilities, etc., when we drive across the grates, they do not go down. We have to be so careful or our tires become punctured. Maybe our congressman could spend a month, incognito, in Puerto Rico where his Republican Party continues to deny emergency service.

That was a blatant lie because U.S. intelligence agencies almost immediately began collecting information on every phone call and electronic communication in the United States. Allegedly even the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign. FISA is a massive invasion of our constitutional right to privacy, and its misuse should alarm all citizens of all political persuasions. Now politicians want to pass new “red flag” gun laws to again “make us safe,\" laws that could punish citizens for what they might possibly do based on mere suspicion. These politicians also promise that these new laws will never be used to deny citizens their constitutional right to keep and bear arms. With their demonstrated track record, should we trust them this time around? I think not.

Please view the following 2018 total compensation from Transparent California: Fire Chief — $492,529 (highest compensated public employee in the county) Deputy Fire Chief — $491,536 (second highest compensated public employee in the county) Fire Captain — $394,001 (fourth highest compensated public employee in the county) Fire Battalion Chief — $390,166 (sixth highest compensated public employee in the county) Of the top 40 paid county employees, 31 are firefighters, and each one is compensated more than $313,000 in 2018. Of the top 80 highest compensated public employees in the county 58 are firefighters, and the lowest compensation of these is $287,254 These personnel are paid more than the county counsel, attorneys, any and all other public servants as a group in the county, and they are making in many cases more than a $250,000 a year in salary and benefits.

      "239 \" When President Trump suggested that two United States representatives should be denied access to visit Israel, our country officially lost the title of being the “United” States. Our democracy assumes that our citizens may disagree and will vote representatives in to advocate for their positions. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that there are politicians who will hold widely divergent views with each other and the president. We do this so that all peoples’ opinions may be heard, considered and represented – a democracy in the truest sense of the word. However, even in our disagreements, regardless of one’s views, we are all citizens of a “United” States. However, when President Trump suggests that some representatives' voices should be marginalized/excluded, he undermines our democracy and unity. Consider how we would react to having our political representatives denied inclusion to a political summit in another country because they were black, Christian Scientists or women — wouldn’t we be outraged and condemn their bigotry? So, too, ought we condemn the bigotry leveled against any of our duly elected officials being denied access because they are Muslim. Consider further, when President Trump encourages this, as he believes that merely because these representatives hold different opinions than he does, that they should be “thrown out” and supposedly “hate America,” and now, must be excluded from doing their job to represent different opinions. This isn’t a democracy anymore, this isfascism.\"\n",

Not one single dollar of the above will do anything to remove the street people. The taxpayers are already paying for city and county governments that need to enforce vagrancy laws that remove wayward people from living anyplace that they want. Our town has plenty of vacant business buildings, with bathrooms and stock yards that should be reinforced with fencing to secure these people with a place to temporarily live. The churches and charities that currently feed the poor can take their meals to the centers, and the city with all of its new tax revenue can hire staff for the centers. The government must work with local businesses to secure housing (lease, rent or have low cost or donated buildings). This would be the most humane and cost effective action that can be done to shelter these unfortunate pilgrims.

These millions of dollars for a new visitor’s center could be better spent on: • Building a causeway bridge at Sierra Way/South Fork and other overdue infrastructure repairs/improvements • Hiring personnel for our embarrassingly understaffed Government Center, which could have a great impact on helping our local veterans, seniors and low-income residents • Giving decent cost-of-living raises to our deputy sheriffs so that we can stop the sky-high turnover rate at our substation • Funding the local organizations who help address our growing homelessness problem.

The phrase, ”the right of the people to bear arms,\" sort of cancels out a “well armed militia,” as being the only ones to have arms. Democrats are attacking the NRA, an organization with 36 percent of members being Democrats. Look at Chicago, a Democrat-controlled city which averages 500 murders a year, in spite of the most stringent gun laws in America. Those who mean to murder can steal a weapon, buy them on the black market or borrow one. The Second Amendment does not need to be abolished or have the language changed. If that’s the case, then we need to also do something about vehicles, considering how many die in accidents and from drunk drivers. The opioid crisis has been swept under the rug until now, with thousands dying from overdoses. Something does need to be done as far as gun legislation, but not taking guns away from “We the People.”'\n",

      "1125 ' Oklahoma’s increased reliance on emergency certification to fill its classrooms with teachers is a troubling trend that must be reversed sooner rather than later. A record 3,038 teachers were admitted during this past school year through that credentialing process, according to reporting from CNHI’s Capitol Bureau. That represents a 9,400% increase from just nine years ago, when the 32 emergency teaching certificates that were issued were relatively rare. If education would have remained the priority it had been when reforms were made during the early 1990s, it is likely there would be little need for emergency teaching certificates today. But tax cuts and incentives to favored industries resulted with funding cuts for schools, which prompted an exodus of teachers from Oklahoma because that profession was less attractive here. We’re certainly appreciative of those professionals willing to share their experience and knowledge with students in classrooms across the state. And there is something to be said about the application of real life to lessons being learned in the classroom, but teaching is a profession that requires more than just knowledge about a particular subject. Educators believe that increased funding the past couple of years could help reverse this trend, but it is going to take a long-term commitment from lawmakers to ensure a steady flow of new teachers ready to enter the system. Any disruption in funding will stall progress that has been made, and Oklahoma cannot afford to go backward when it comes to education. ~ The Muskogee Phoenix'\n",

      "1171 ' The recent ceremonial signing of a bill that will require that state agencies post annual reports identifying the federal funds received by each and the extent to which they are relied upon served as a reminder of the importance of government transparency. Senate Bill 271 was signed officially on April 29, but Gov. Kevin Stitt gathered with co-authors Sen. Nathan Dahm and Rep. Kyle Hilbert and bill backers for a more formal signing to boost awareness of the law and its impact. Knowing how much federal funds a state agency receives and the extent to which it relies on those funds will present a better picture for taxpayers who care about state spending. According to reporting from the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, Dahm, a Broken Arrow Republican, said lawmakers too often focus on appropriated funds while ignoring other funding sources state agencies regularly receive and use. That tendency apparently has been used by some as smoke and mirrors during the budgeting process. Now there may be times when federal funds may make an agency appear flush with funds — the infusion of stimulus funds following the global market collapse in 2008, for example. Lawmakers must exercise caution to guard against taking punitive measures for temporary infusion of funds. But overall, transparency in government should be the goal in every policy decision. And knowing what funds an agency has available and the extent to which it relies on those funds is a good thing — we look forward to reading those annual reports. ~ The Muskogee Phoenix'\n",

Imagine my pain when I opened up a recent edition of the Charleston Gazette-Mail and saw another Marshall-related story title with his picture on it. I’m not sure what the editors/publishers are trying to accomplish by putting him back in a paper based in Charleston, but it can’t be to sell papers. I could poll everyone I know, and absolutely none of them would say they enjoyed reading anything Chuck Landon has ever written.

On Page 1D, though, there was an article by Senate President Mitch Carmichael, R-Jackson, who said we have a dumbed-down education system and the best solution is charter schools and education savings accounts. I am a proud father of two sons who graduated from Jackson County schools. One is the owner of his own business and the other recently retired as a major from the Marine Corps (not too bad). Then, I recalled a lad from the Raleigh County school system who learned to play the fiddle and became the majority leader of the U.S. Senate (not too bad). There are thousands of these achiever stories of graduates from West Virginia schools. As I ponder about Mitch’s article, I wonder if he got someone who was educated from out of state to write it.

Since then, while other states have implemented programs for relief, our state has moved at a glacial pace while the suffering takes no break. This is a Legislature that, when the issue is one they believe in, can and will suspend rules and procedures to get what they want. Were it convenient to declare Flat Earth Day to provide a smokescreen for coal tax breaks, disband public education and deregulate environmental safeguards, a special session would be held tomorrow and last a day.

      "2321 'The debate over whether it’s safer for a healthy woman to have a baby at home or in the hospital just tilted a bit in favor of hospital deliveries. The risks in both cases are very low, but a new study suggests that the risk to babies could be higher for out-of-hospital births. A study, based on data from Oregon and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December, found that the risk of a baby dying was 3.9 per 1,000 births for deliveries at home or in birth centers, versus 1.8 deaths per 1,000 births in hospitals. Although the vast majority of births occur in hospitals, the percentage of deliveries at home or in birth centers outside hospitals rose to 1.28 percent in 2012, up from 0.79 percent in 2004, in part because a growing number of women want to avoid the high-tech interventionist environment of hospitals. In fact, the study found that planned out-of-hospital births had decreased odds of induced labor, cesarean delivery and other obstetric procedures. Earlier studies in this country and abroad found that deliveries outside hospitals were as safe as hospital deliveries. In late 2014, Britain’s National Health Service concluded that for healthy women expecting uncomplicated deliveries, it was actually safer for both mother and child if the birth was at home rather than in a hospital maternity ward, where doctors were more likely to use surgical interventions or spinal anesthetics that could cause harm. But one problem with previous studies was that if a crisis developed during a home or birth center delivery that required a transfer to a hospital and the baby subsequently died, it was counted as a hospital death, not as a problem that developed outside the hospital. The latest study is superior because, using data newly available in Oregon, it more accurately shows where the problem occurred, not just where the women ended up giving birth. It is seldom wise to rely too heavily on a single study; nevertheless, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine offers data that doctors and patients should consider.'\n",

It isn’t illegal, but it has been common practice for most candidates since insurance commissioner became an elected position in 1990. For good reason: The commissioner regulates (including, in some instances, approving rates) a $310 billion industry, and — excuse us for being cynical — pocketing big campaign checks might create the appearance of a conflict of interest. However, as the San Diego Union- Tribune reported this week, Lara started taking insurance money after he was elected. Lara, who took office in January, collected $53,000 from insurance interests for his 2022 reelection committee during his first six months on the job. After the news broke, Lara said it was a mistake, thanked the paper for drawing it to his attention and said he would get rid of his campaign treasurer.

Fifteen of Sonoma County’s largest employers and educational institutions will work with the chamber to evaluate proposals, with an emphasis on infill, multi-family housing and development near transit lines. As the low-interest loans are repaid, funding will be available for additional projects.

The price of oil is as high as it has been since 2014, at almost $76 per barrel, and that has pushed pump prices higher across the country rather than the typical drop off following the summer driving season, according to AAA Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, the statewide average is nearly 50 cents higher than a year ago at $2.72 for a gallon of regular unleaded. Monday’s national gas price average is $2.91, which is up three cents in the last week, up seven cents in the last month, and 39 cents higher than this time last year. “Crude oil accounts for half of the retail pump price, and crude is selling at some of the highest price points in four years,”AAA Oklahoma'sLeslie Gamble said. “That means fall and year-end prices are going to be unseasonably expensive. Even with refineries switching over to the less expensive 'winter blend,' there's no relief this year.” U.S. sanctions against Iran, set to go into effect Nov. 4, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry's recent dismissal of the idea of additional Strategic Petroleum Reserve sales, helped boost oil prices to nearly four-year highs. While markets still are focused on the prospect of tight global supply as U.S. sanctions on Iran kick in, recent reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia have reached an agreement to increase production might help ease supply concerns.\"\n",

      "4912 'Yeager Airport’s runway was closed and all air traffic halted for about two hours for emergency repairs on Monday, as workers repaired a 3-inch crack in a section of the runway. Extreme heat followed by heavy, cooling rain is believed to have played a role in causing the pavement to separate, according to officials at the Charleston airport. The runway was closed shortly before noon after the problem was discovered and airport engineers, Air National Guard personnel and representatives of West Virginia Paving developed a plan to temporarily repair the pavement and work on a more complete solution during night hours. “We were fortunate to have West Virginia Paving on site, and we’re thankful to them and the West Virginia Air National Guard for their help in getting the runway reopened quickly,” said Terry Sayre, director of the Charleston airport. Sayre apologized for having to inconvenience some commercial airline travelers to make the emergency repairs, but said “the safety of our passengers is our No. 1 priority.” In other developments at Yeager on Monday, the airport’s 20-minute courtesy parking lot was closed to accommodate construction of a solar panel array atop one of its two parking buildings. More than 1,800 solar modules will make up the array, expected to produce power for both parking buildings and supply a portion of the rest of the airport’s power needs. The rooftop array is expected to generate enough electricity to supply the equivalent of the power consumption of 70 homes. Most of the funding for the project is supplied by the Federal Aviation Administration. Free 20-minute parking and access to Uber and Lyft rideshare services will be available in a section of Yeager’s short-term parking lot while the regular courtesy parking lot is closed.'\n",

      "4975 'A trial date has been set in the case of a Dunbar woman accused of stabbing and killing a St. Albans woman and then sexually abusing her body. Courtney Shawn Wallace, 21, appeared before Kanawha Circuit Judge Jennifer Bailey on Tuesday for her arraignment on felony charges of murder and first-degree sexual abuse in an incident that took place earlier this year. On the afternoon of Jan. 17, the St. Albans Police Department responded to a call on Furlong Avenue about a stabbing incident, according to a criminal complaint obtained in Kanawha County Circuit Court. When police entered the residence, they saw Wallace standing in the hallway covered in blood and nude from the chest down. The complaint alleges she refused to follow orders given by police and tried to get away before they were able to get her under control. Officers then saw Cherri Simpson lying on the floor with stab wounds to her front and rear torso and said she appeared to not be breathing. Her daughter, Lillie Simpson, said Wallace had taken a kitchen knife and stabbed her mother multiple times, performed sexual acts on her unresponsive body, and then urinated on the floor beside it. Kanawha County Emergency Ambulance Authority arrived on the scene and started CPR on Simspon and then transported her to Thomas Memorial Hospital where she died as a result of her injuries. Wallace pleaded not guilty to the charges, and Bailey set her trial for 9 a.m. Nov. 12. Wallace is being held in South Central Regional Jail on a $100,000 cash-only bond for the charge of first-degree sexual abuse and no bond for the murder charge.'\n",

      "5160 'State Election Commissioners on Wednesday authorized testing of an upgraded voting system that will allow clerks in 33 counties to reconfigure the ballot order, after West Virginia lawmakers mandated that change earlier this year. The updated version of the ExpressVote System will allow for customization of ballots, needed under legislation passed in March changing the ballot location for nonpartisan judicial elections. Under the legislation (HB 2600), beginning with the May 2020 primary election, judicial elections will appear on the ballot after national and state offices and ahead of county offices. Since judicial elections became nonpartisan in 2016, races for Supreme Court, circuit court, family court judges, and magistrates have appeared at the foot of the ballot, along with other nonpartisan elections, such as county school boards. Heeding concerns that voters might drop off before reaching the judicial elections, legislators voted to reconfigure the ballot order. Donald Kersey, Elections Division director for the Secretary of State’s office, said the upgrade is needed in 33 counties where current systems lack the ability to customize ballots. The upgrade also includes enhanced security features, which the commissioners discussed Wednesday in executive session via teleconference with representatives of Election Systems & Software, the manufacturer of the ExpressVote System voting machines. “We want to make sure we’re doing all we can to protect our voters,” Kersey said. The system upgrade has yet to receive certification from the federal Elections Assistance Commission, but ES&S officials said that certification is expected to come down later this month or early in October. Once that certification is obtained and testing of the upgraded system is completed by consultants retained by the Elections Commission, commissioners will meet again to give final approval to the change.'\n",

Several signs at the popular tourist destination warn against trespassing on or climbing the sculpture, which was completed in 1941.

The balloon was flown despite a temporary Federal Aviation Administration restriction issued last week banning “balloon operations” and other flying objects — airplanes, gliders and model rockets — in the area. “We’re kind of wondering if they’re targeting us,” William Johnson of the Backbone Campaign, which brought the balloon, said of the FAA restriction.

       "' What a wonderful water year it has been. We have had water in the Kern River through Bakersfield since February and it is now October. What a beautiful difference this has made in the community as a whole. It has been an aesthetic and recreational paradise and has continuously recharged our groundwater for future use. My daily commute is along the Kern River running through our beautiful city so I have been able to observe and enjoy many of the sites and sounds made possible by this phenomenon. I have heard the whitewater rushing underneath me as I cross the pedestrian bicycle bridge at Riverwalk Park. On that same bridge, I have seen hundreds of families and couples taking a walk and soaking in the natural wonder of the surroundings. In the early mornings and evenings, I have shared with others the joys of the beautiful sunrise and sunsets across the water. In the midday summer sun, I have had the pleasure of watching families playing together in the water at Beach Park, Yokuts Park and Riverwalk Park. The waterfowl along the Kern River through town has been spectacular; this year I have delighted in the flocks of ducks, the great white herons and the ever present hawks. The Bike Bakersfield Full Moon Rides along the Kern River gave many families and friends the opportunity to appreciate and absorb the natural beauty of our community as the sun set in the west and the moon was rising in the east. Many times while bicycling along the Kern River by moonlight, I would luxuriate in the quiet and absorb the beauty of the city lights reflecting off of the water. All of the above is wonderful and provides quality of life benefits to our community that is spectacular but hard to measure. What we can measure is the amount and benefit of the groundwater recharge that is taking place every minute of every day that water is flowing in the Kern River through our community. This year we have recharged well over 130,000 acre feet of water by flowing water in the Kern River and beyond in the city of Bakersfield’s 2,800 acre recharge facility just west of the urban portion of our city. This has been made possible by a number of factors — the most important is that we had a great winter last year and therefore had a snowpack that was almost 200 percent of normal. We have also worked hard to make sure that we did not waste this opportunity and stored as much as possible in our underground reservoir. Much of this effort is in collaboration with the various water districts that the city works with to deliver water to our agricultural community. I want to personally thank all of them for their willingness to work together for the benefit of the community as a whole. Early in the year we worked with the Kern County Water Agency on behalf of multiple agencies including themselves and were able to have water in the Kern River from the Friant Kern Canal which terminates at the Kern River near Coffee Road and all four of the Cross Valley Canal Turnouts. We worked with North Kern Water Storage District to deliver water after it flows through the city. Its water was delivered near Riverwalk Park and then into a canal system and on to the agricultural fields. Kern County Water Agency also has helped by delivering some of its urban water allotment from the state water project into the Kern River near Golden State Avenue and then flowing through our city. We have also worked with Buena Vista Water Storage District, Arvin-Edison Water Storage District, Kern Delta Water District, West Kern Water District, Rosedale Rio Bravo Water Storage District and the Henry Miller Water District to move and store water using the Kern River through the city of Bakersfield. Water in the Kern River through Bakersfield is an exceptional quality of life amenity and an economic driver for the community at large. Water recharged into our underground reservoir is critical for the long term sustainability of our community. What a wonderful water year it has been. Bob Smith is the Bakersfield Ward 4 councilman, board member of the Kern River Groundwater Sustainability Agency and chairman of the City of Bakersfield Water Board.'"

       "' I’ve been reading posts online about “those” homeless people and myths about them. They’re not bused here, they’re from here, and they’re our family. All homeless people aren’t drug addicts, criminals, mentally ill or lazy. They each have their own reason for being homeless and most want to work. We need affordable housing and people certified to do community health outreach work so they can truly connect with our homeless. I’m concerned about a plan to cite people with nowhere to go simply because we don’t want to see them and we’re more concerned with NIMBYisms, which include not in my neighborhood, business, city/county. We want citations/tickets/fines (which they cannot afford), court dates (which they cannot get to), drummed up reasons for tickets, arrests and a big push into a system of bail, attorney fees, understanding of court language and plea bargains? This is not a solution. Is there a problem? Yes. Something needs to be done, but this “plan” is not the way. Don’t criminalize homeless people. Bakersfield and Kern County can get creative and come up with solutions that help meet the needs of our homeless. Where are our Good Samaritans? Where are our fellow Christians? And what about our Golden Rule? I can tell you they are there within the homeless, with you and me, and they understand the importance of doing unto others as we would have done to us.'"
